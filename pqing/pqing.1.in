.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program performs real-time capture of meteorological data into an
LDM product queue (see \fBpq(3)\fP).  It is part of the Unidata
Local Data Management system (LDM).  The input data is assumed to be in the
form of ``meteorological messages'' specified by the World Meteorological
Organization in WMO Publication 386 (``WMO format''), or in AFOS format.
It reads from
\fIfeedname\fR looking for messages.  Each message is encapsulated as a
``data product'' and the WMO header or AFOS identifer is assigned as the
product's identifying
key.  The product is then inserted at the end of the specified product queue
for further processing.  The product queue should already exist (see
\fBpqcreate(1)\fP).  
.LP
This program is typically run in the background with a local \fBldmd(1)\fP
server (OR \fBpqsend(1)\fP)
to supply input to a distribution tree.
.LP
Multiple instances of
\fBpqing\fP may insert products from different feeds into the same product
queue.
.LP
This program can read from a file of previously captured raw data or an
asynchronous text feed such as the Alden's International Data Service.
.LP
As a convenience, the program changes its default baud rate based on
its name (argv[0]). For example, if the program is invoked as \fBids \fR,
the baud rate set to 9600. For afos, the default baud rate is 4800.  The program
name also effects a ``feedtype'' field in the product data structure, which
helps to uniquely identify a
data product. Conventionally, \fB ddplus, ids,\fR 
\fBhds \fR and \fBafos \fR are links to \fBpqing \fR.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 8
.B \-v
Verbose flag.  If present, the log will contain a line for 
each product that was ingested, giving the time read, header, and 
size of the product. 
.TP
.B \-x
Debug flag. Way too much output.
.TP
.BI \-r " rawfile"
The path name of a file 
to be used to capture the raw data seen on the input without processing
it in any way.  This can later be used for testing by giving this
file as the \fIfeedname\fP argument.  \fBWARNING:\fP If this program is
invoked with this option and is left running, then the file system will 
eventually fill up.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Assert that the feedtype is \fIfeedtype\fR, one of \fBhds, ddplus, 
ids,\fR etc. Useful when sending data from a file. If the feedtype is
AFOS, then the input is parsed as AFOS products, otherwise, WMO format
is assumed.
.TP
.BI \-s " size"
The size, in bytes, of the largest expected data-product. Unidentified
data larger than this is discarded. The default is 1,048,576.
.TP
.BI \-b " baud"
Set the baud rate of the feed. This makes no difference unless data is
being read from a \fBtty\fP.
The default varies according to feedtype.
.TP
.BI "-q " q_path
The pathname of the data product queue.
The default is
.nh
\fB$(regutil regpath{QUEUE_PATH})\fP
.hy
This configuration default can
be overridden by setting the environment variable \fBLDMPQFNAME\fP.
.TP
.B "\-P port"
Get input via TCP connection to host \fIfeedname\fP at \fIport\fP.
.TP
.B "\-p even|odd|none"
Check the parity of the feed.  This makes no difference unless data is
being read from a \fBtty\fP.  The default varies according to feedtype.
.TP
.B "\-c"
For an HDS feed, the feed contains checksums. If the checksum is
invalid, the product is not enqueued.
For other FOS feeds (DDS, IDS, DDPLUS), check for the tty parity
errors. If one occurs, the product is not enqueued.
This option is assumed if the data is being read from a \fBtty\fP.
.TP
.B "\-F"
Enable XON/XOFF software flow control for input from a \fBtty\fP. The default is
to disable software flow control.
.TP
.B "\-n"
Disable the checksum or parity check on data being read from a
tty. This would be used on textual FOS feeds in situations where
data quanity was more important than quality.
.TP
.B "\-5"
Perform checksum calculation on entire product.  By default, in calculating the
checksum pqing
determines whether the product's leading control string qualifies the product as a
WMO product, and if so it then calculates the checksum on the portion of
the product that does not include the leading control string.  This
way, products that differ only by sequence number will have
identical signatures.  The -5 option disables this feature, causing
pqing to calculate the checksum based on the entire product, including
the sequence number.
.SH "INPUT FEED"
The source for the ingester, whether a tty
device or a file, is specified by the required
\fIfeedname\fP argument.  Possible values of the \fIfeedname\fP are:
.TP 8
.BR /dev/tty\fIx\fR " or " /dev/tty\fIxx\fR
Asynchronous feed on a UNIX system.  \fIxx\fP identifies the 
serial port.
.TP
.I filename
Specification of file containing raw data previously captured by one of the
LDM programs \fBpqing\fP, \fBingestd\fP, \fBfeedtest\fP, or \fBldmd\fP.  Use
of the filename ``\fB\-\fP'' forces the program to read from standard input.
.SH SIGNALS
On receipt of the following signals, the specified action occurs:
.TP
SIGUSR1
.B Refresh logging (if configure(1) executed without the "--with-ulog" option) and
write accumulated statistics to the logfile.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Toggle the \fIverbose\fP flag.
.LP
On successful insertion of a product into the product queue, SIGCONT is sent
to \fBpqing\fP's process group, informing all queue processes that are
members of the same process group that a new product has arrived.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error and log messages are written using the ulog(3) interface.
Nothing is written to standard output by the program.
A summary of ingest statistics is
output when the process terminates.  Statistics may also be
appended to the log file at any time while the process is running by
sending a \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal to the process.
